Rigid Body Simulation on the GPU

## Inspiration
* [Real-Time Rigid Body Simulation on GPUs](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch29.html)
* [Unity Compute Shaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf9nadEEmtw)

## Estimates
The goal of the project is to simulate rigid body physics on the GPU based on the techniques described in chapter 29 of the book GPU Gems 3, “Real-Time Rigid Body Simulation on GPUs” by Takahiro Harada.

The project description is split into six parts:
* Data Structures and Research
* Computation of Particle Values
* Grid Generation
* Collision Detection and Reaction
* Computation of Momenta
* Computation of Position and Quaternion

An initial estimate for this project will be three months. This estimate essentially provides for approximately two weeks per section of the project. This will allow time for learning, failure, experimentation, comparison, profiling and testing the techniques described in the original document.
