## Estimates
The goal of the project is to simulate rigid body physics on the GPU based on the techniques described in chapter 29 of the book GPU Gems 3, “Real-Time Rigid Body Simulation on GPUs” by Takahiro Harada.

The project description is split into six parts:
Data Structures and Research
Computation of Particle Values
Grid Generation
Collision Detection and Reaction
Computation of Momenta
Computation of Position and Quaternion

An initial estimate for this project will be a beefy six months. This sounds a little like sandbagging but since this is based around trying to learn as much as possible, I think it is quite reasonable. This estimate essentially provides one month for each section of the project. This will allow time for learning, failure, experimentation, comparison, profiling and testing the techniques described in the original document.
